title: 05 More errors
---

Today's lectures follows
[last's lecture on numbers]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2016-01-28-04_Numbers_and_errors %}) and discusses the accumulation of
errors in algorithms. The key insight is that the total error consists
of an algorithmic error (also known as the approximation error), which
typically decreases with increasing the computational cost and a
round-off error, which increases with the number of operations or the
computational cost.

You can follow the lecture in the notebook
[05_errors.ipynb](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ASU-CompMethodsPhysics-PHY494/PHY494-resources/blob/master/05_errors/05_errors.ipynb).
