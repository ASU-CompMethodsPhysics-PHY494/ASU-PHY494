title: 17 Final Poster Symposium
---

Students worked on a **Final Project** in teams of two or three students and presented results as posters on 5/5/2016 in a conference-like setting, which we called the **Final Symposium**. Each student held a Q&A dicussion with the instructor in front of the poster.[^1]

Seven teams looked at problems ranging from navigation in the solar system to the best strategy to win Black Jack. Each team started with a proposal, defined goals, and used computational techniques learned during the semester to achieve their goals:

The code and the posters are available in the GitHub repositories. Further details, including abstracts and licensing information, is available in the [Symposium Program (PDF)]({{site.baseurl}}/{{site.docs}}/program_symposium_2016.pdf).

The winner of the **Poster Prize** was team #4 with the project [Digital Signal Processing Techniques in Python][soundprocessor].[^2] They generated sound effects in Python and then transferred them to a Raspberry Pi in order to manipulate voice and guitar input in real time.

#### Notes

[^1]: Each discussion was timed for 6 minutes and graded. Students
      were awarded a grade for their final that consisted of a grade
      for the whole project (collectively graded for the whole team)
      and the Q&A garde, which provides an individual component.

[^2]: The Poster Prize was awarded based on a vote by all participants.
