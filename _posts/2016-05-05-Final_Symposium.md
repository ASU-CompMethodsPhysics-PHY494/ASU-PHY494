title: 17 Final Poster Symposium
---

Students worked on a **Final Project** in teams of three students and presented results as posters on 5/5/2016 in a conference-like setting, which we called the **Final Symposium**. Each student held a Q&A dicussion with the instructor in front of the poster.[^1]

Seven teams looked at problems ranging from navigation in the solar system to the best strategy to win Black Jack:

| #  | title  | team  | repository |

| 2  | Billiard Simulation  | @NSoderberg103, @N-Obrien, @kitwingfung  | [billiard] |
| 3  | Blackjack Card Counting Simulation  | @rhheilma, @lnbradsh, @jtdwyer93  | [blackjack] |
| 4  | Digital Signal Processing Techniques in Python | @Izymandias, @SkyHugo, @tvanenge  | [soundprocessor] |
| 5  | Predictive Model of the 2016 March Madness Tournament | @bkatterm, @ja-martinez | [march madness] | 
| 6  | Rendezvous with Rama: Ramageddon! | @jbboyd, @aamascar, @andywinhold | [rama] |
| 7  | Stern-Gerlach Simulation  | @andrewdurkiewicz, @ion201 | [Stern-Gerlach] |

The code and the posters are available in the GitHub repositories.

The winner of the **Poster Prize** was team #4 with the project [Digital Signal Processing Techniques in Python][soundprocessor].[^2] They generated sound effects in Python and then transferred them to a Raspberry Pi in order to manipulate voice and guitar input in real time.

### References and Notes

[^1]: Each discussion was timed for 6 minutes and graded. Students
      were awarded a grade for their final that consisted of a grade
      for the whole project (collectively graded for the whole team)
      and the Q&A garde, which provides an individual component.

[^2]: The Poster Prize was awarded based on a vote by all participants.
