title: 03 The first Python program
number: 30
---

In your work directory, create a directory `~/PHY494/03_python` and go
to this directory:

{% highlight bash %}
mkdir ~/PHY494/03_python
cd ~/PHY494/03_python
{% endhighlight %}

## Hello World ##

Using you favorite editor (for instance, `atom`), create a text file named `hello.py` in the
directory `~/PHY494/03_python`[^1] with the
following content:

{% highlight python %}
# hello world in Python

name = input("What's your name? --> ")
print("Hello ", name, ", it's great to see you here.")
{% endhighlight %}

Execute ("run") your `hello.py` program with the `python` program:

{% highlight bash %}
python hello.py
{% endhighlight %}

It should ask you for your name: type it and hit `Enter`. You should
be greeted nicely with a message on your screen.

- The line starting with `#` is a comment and Python ignores
  everything on the line starting with the comment character.
- Blank lines are ignored.
- `name` is a _variable_: it stores a value (more later); variable names are arbitrary (as
  long as you only use letters, numbers, underscore, don't start with
  a number, and don't use a name that is already used by Python)
- `input()` and `print()` are _functions_: they take values as input
  and do something with it (more later).
  
### What's a Python program?

* A text file with content that follows the [rules of the Python
  programming
  language](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/index.html).
  
  Customarily, we add the suffix `.py` to the filename, but this is
  not required.
* The text file is read by the `python` interpreter (a program) and
  executed.
  

## Python interpreter ##

[Python](https://www.python.org/) is an interpreted language; you can
think of `python` reading each line in an input file and executing
it. Start `python` on its own:

{% highlight bash %}
python
{% endhighlight %}

You should see something like

        Python 3.6.8 |Anaconda, Inc.| (default, Dec 29 2018, 19:04:46)
        [GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Clang 4.0.1 (tags/RELEASE_401/final)] on darwin
        Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
        >>>


The Python prompt is `>>>`.

Type commands and execute them with `Enter`. Like the shell, Python is
a *REPL*, a "Read-eval-print-loop". For example, to add two numbers

{% highlight python %}
>>> 41 + 1
42
>>> 1.5 + 5e-1
2.0
{% endhighlight %}

Exit with `quit()` or `Ctrl + d`.

### Help! ###
In Python you can often get _help_ by saying
{% highlight python %}
>>> help()
>>> help("something")
{% endhighlight %}

For example, get help on the addition operator (and much more):

{% highlight python %}
>>> help("+")
{% endhighlight %}



### Activity: Python as a calculator ###
Start `python` and figure out [^2] how to compute the left hand sides (the
right hand sides are there for you to check your results):

\begin{align}
-1 + 2 &= 1\\\
102 - 201 &= -99\\\
12345678987654321 \times 9876543210123456789 &= 121932631979881115785550983112635269\\\
3/2 &= 1.5\\\
\frac{1}{1 - 0.9^2} &= 5.263157894736843\\\
1 + \frac{2}{1} + \frac{2^2}{1\cdot2} + \frac{2^3}{1\cdot2\cdot3} +
\frac{2^4}{1 \cdot 2\cdot3\cdot4} &= 7.0\\\
-3^4 &= -81\\\
2 - 5.5\times 10^{-7} &= 1.99999945\\\
1.672621898\times 10^{-27} \times (3\times10^8)^2 &= 1.5053597082 \times 10^{-10}\\\
\sqrt{2} &= 1.4142135623730951\\\
\sqrt{-1} &= i\\\
(1 + 2i) + (-2 + i) &= -1 + 3i\\\
\frac{1 + 2i}{2 - i} &= i\\\
\end{align}

### More operations

- floor division ("integer division") `//` [^5]
- remainder `%`

{% highlight python %}
>>> 13 / 3  # division returns a float
4.333333333333333
>>> 13 // 3  # floor division discards the fractional part
4
>>> 13 % 3  # the % operator returns the remainder of the division
1
>>> 4 * 3 + 1  # result * divisor + remainder
13
{% endhighlight %}

### Potential problems...

Division by zero _raises an error_ (an "exception"):
{% highlight python %}
>>> 1/0
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
{% endhighlight %}

Floating point numbers are not real real numbers (more later):
calculating
$$
10 + 10^{-16} = 10.0000000000000001
$$
in Python

{% highlight python %}
>>> 10 + 1e-16
10.0
{% endhighlight %}
does not give the expected answer!


### Activity: hello, line by line ###

Type the commands from `hello.py` into the interpreter, hitting `Enter`
after every line, and execute your program step by step.

## Basic plotting ##

Create a file `motion.py` with content

{% highlight python %}
# plot motion with constant acceleration

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

a = 1.0    # acceleration
v0 = 0.0   # initial velocity

t, h, n = 0.0, 0.1, 20    # init time, step size, number of steps
ta, xa = [], []           # time and position lists

for i in range(n):
    x = v0*t + a*t*t/2.0
    ta.append(t)
    xa.append(x)
    t = t + h

# plot results
plt.figure(figsize=(4, 4))
plt.plot(ta, xa, '-o', color="red", linewidth=2)
plt.xlabel("t (s)")
plt.ylabel("x (m)")

plt.savefig("motion.png")
plt.show()
{% endhighlight %}

You should create a graph similar to the following:

![Constant acceleration plot]({{site.baseurl}}/{{site.figs}}/motion.png)

## Interactive Python with `ipython` ##

The [ipython](http://ipython.org) interpreter is like `python` but with
*lots* of improvements such as `TAB`-completion, help with `command?`
(one question mark directly following a command) and source code with
`command??` (two question marks), command line history, and many
additional shell-like commands (so-called "magic" commands such as
`%cd`, `%ls`, `%pwd`, `%run`, `%time` and `%timeit` --- see `%magic`
for help).

Start it with
{% highlight bash %}
ipython
{% endhighlight %}

It should look like

~~~~~
Python 3.6.8 |Anaconda, Inc.| (default, Dec 29 2018, 19:04:46)
Type 'copyright', 'credits' or 'license' for more information
IPython 7.3.0 -- An enhanced Interactive Python. Type '?' for help.

In [1]:
~~~~~

where `In [1]:` is the prompt.

Use `ipython` instead of `python` for interactive work because it is
much more userfriendly.

### `ipython` basics

* To exit, give the `exit()` command or `^D` (`Control` + `D`).
* Use arrow keys to move up and down through the history or through
  multi-line commands.
* Use TAB-completion.
* Use `command?` or `?command` (question mark directly before or after
  a command or object) to get help
* `%run FILE` executes FILE similarly to `python
  FILE`.[^3]


### `ipython` with `matplotlib`

In the basic plotting example we used the `matplotlib` library for
plotting and wrote a figure to a file. `ipython` can show figures
interactively but the details depend on your operating system and
installed packages. Try the following and see if the figure is
displayed on your screen when you run `motion.py`: [^4]

#### Windows

Run `ipython qtconsole` to show graphics inline:

{% highlight bash %}
ipython qtconsole
{% endhighlight %}

In `ipython` [^3]
{% highlight python %}
%run motion.py
{% endhighlight %}





#### macOS

Run `ipython`

{% highlight bash %}
ipython --matplotlib=osx
{% endhighlight %}


In `ipython` [^3]
{% highlight python %}
%run motion.py
{% endhighlight %}


#### Linux

Run `ipython`
{% highlight bash %}
ipython --matplotlib=gtk3
{% endhighlight %}

(If `gtk3` does not work, try `qt5`, `qt`, `wx`, `tk`, `auto`, or just
`--matplotlib`.)


In `ipython` [^3]
{% highlight python %}
%run motion.py
{% endhighlight %}

#### Footnotes ####

    If you can call your editor from the command line then this is as
    easy as, for example with `atom` (or `nano`),

         cd ~/PHY494/03_python
         atom hello.py

    This will open a new file with name `hello.py` or open an existing
    file if it is present.

    However, if you use an editor that you have to open from, say, the
    Windows Start menu, then you need to first open the editor and
    then use a menu command such as *File → New* to create a blank
    document (use or *File → Open* to open an existing file). Once you
    have written content you need to *save it in the correct location*
    (usually, or *File → Save*). To find the `03_python` directory,
    first navigate to your home directory:

        * This can be tricky on **Windows** : In your shell (not in your
          editor), type `cd; pwd` to learn the path to your home
          directory. In your editor's file system dialog window, start
          from the system disk (normally `C:` under *Computer*) and look
          for `C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME`.

        * On Apple **Mac OS X**, your home directory is `/Users/YOUR_USERNAME`.

        * On typical **Linux** distributions it is `/home/YOUR_USERNAME`.
        
    In your home directory, locate the `PHY494` folder, click on it to
    find the `03_python` folder inside and click on the
    latter. Provide the file name ("hello.py") and save the file. (In
    the shell, make sure that the file is in place where you expect it
    to be, i.e., `ls -la`.)

    If you need [help](#help), look at [Using Python as a
    Calculator](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#using-python-as-a-calculator)
    in the standard Python Tutorial.

    `%run` is an ipython "magic" command, see help on those commands
    with `%magic`.

    If you don't want to see graphics inline but as a separate window
    you can try
        
                ipython --matplotlib=qt5
    
    (If `qt5` does not work, try `qt`, `wx`, `tk`, `auto`, or just
    `--matplotlib`.)
        
    However, this does not always work and might require additional
    packages. Please share any insights and solutions!

    In Python 2, the `/` division operator would perform floor       division _if both operands were integers_ but normal ("true") division if
    at least one operand was a floating point number. Therefore, in
    old Python 2 code you might see constructs such as `1.0 * a / 2`
    to force a true division, no matter the value of the variable   `a`. In Python 3, the `/` operator _always_ 
    performs true division, which prevents some rather nasty bugs from occuring.
