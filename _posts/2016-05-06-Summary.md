title: 18 Summary and Review
---

Students learned to use the computer to solve numerical problems in
physics. It was hard work and at times frustrating (according to the
feedback) but finally getting an algorithm to work and a test to pass
instilled a sense of having acquired new tools for the future that
will allow them to solve problems on their own.
