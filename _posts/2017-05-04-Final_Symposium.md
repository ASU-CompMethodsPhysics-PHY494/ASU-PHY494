title: Final Poster Symposium
---

Students worked on a **Final Project** in teams of two or three students and presented results as posters on 5/4/2017 in a conference-like setting, which we called the **Final Symposium**. Each student held a Q&A dicussion with the instructor in front of the poster.[^1]

Six teams looked at problems ranging from quantum mechanics to astrophysics. Each team started with a proposal, defined goals, and used computational techniques learned during the semester to achieve their goals:

#### Notes

[^1]: Each discussion was timed for about 10 minutes and graded. Students
      were awarded a grade for their final that consisted of a grade
      for the whole project (collectively graded for the whole team)
      and the Q&A garde, which provides an individual component.
