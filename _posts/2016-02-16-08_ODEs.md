title: 08 Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)
---

Most physical phenomena are ultimately described by a relationship
between changing quantities, resulting in differential equations. If
such an equation only contains one independent variable (such as time)
and hence only total derivatives (and no partial derivatives) we
classify it as an
**[ordinary differential equation](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/OrdinaryDifferentialEquation.html)**
(**ODE**). An ODE of order $$n$$ contains no derivatives higher than
the $$n$$-th derivative:

$$
F(t, y, y^{(1)},  \dots, y^{(n)}) = 0
$$

The *dependent* variable $$y = y(t)$$ is a function of the
*independent variable* $$t$$ and $$y^{(n)} = \frac{d^{n}y}{dt^{n}}$$
is the $$n$$-th derivative with respect to $$t$$. A *linear ODE* only
contains first powers of $$y$$ or its derivatives. A *non-linear ODE*
may contain higher powers. There often exist methods to solve linear
ODEs analytically but this is impossible for most non-linear
ODEs. Solutions of an ODE are fixed by the initial conditions[^1],
e.g., $$y_0 = y(t_{0})$$ and similar for all higher derivatives. For
an ODE of order $$n$$, exactly $$n$$ initial conditions are needed.

Using ODE integration algorithms (*integrators*) we can solve linear
*and* non-linear ODEs of any order *numerically*. The basic idea is to
start with the initial conditions and then propagate $$y$$ for a small
step $$h$$ to numerically compute $$y(t_0 + h)$$ and all its
derivatives. By repeating the process, one *extrapolates* from the
initial condition to any "later" value of $$t$$.

We will first study the simplest integrator, the *Euler* algorithm, and
then look at a more robust class of integrators, the *Runge-Kutta*
schemes.

## ODEs, standard form, and principles of integrators

The first part of this lesson introduces the formalism and the basic
ideas behind integration algorithms.

The Jupyter notebook
[08_ODEs.ipynb](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/format/slides/github/ASU-CompMethodsPhysics-PHY494/PHY494-resources/blob/master/08_ODEs/08_ODEs.ipynb#/)
contains the lecture notes. Skeleton code for in-class problem
exercises is in
[08_ODEs-students-1.ipynb](https://github.com/ASU-CompMethodsPhysics-PHY494/PHY494-resources/blob/master/08_ODEs/08_ODEs-students-1.ipynb).[^2]

## Accuracy and performance of Euler and Runge-Kutta integrators

The second part shows how to assess the accuracy of integration
algorithms and analyzes in more depth the simple
[Euler integrator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_method) and the
[Runge-Kutta methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge%E2%80%93Kutta_methods),
namely `rk2` and `rk4` (and `rk45`). As examples we use the simple 1D
harmonic oscillator with potential energy function $$U(x) =
\frac{1}{2} k x^2$$, an anharmonic oscillator ($$U(x) = \frac{1}{2} k
x^2 (1-\frac{2}{3} \alpha x)$$), and a 6-th power oscillator ($$U(x) =
\frac{1}{6} k x^6$$).

contains the lecture notes. Skeleton code for in-class problem
exercises can be found in the notebook [08_ODE_integrators-students-1.ipynb](https://github.com/ASU-CompMethodsPhysics-PHY494/PHY494-resources/blob/master/08_ODEs/08_ODE_integrators-students-1.ipynb).[^2]

#### Footnotes

[^1]:

     Solutions to ODEs can also be restricted by *boundary conditions*
     (values of the solution on the domain boundary) but this leads to
     difficult Eigenvalue problems and will not be considered in this
     lesson.
