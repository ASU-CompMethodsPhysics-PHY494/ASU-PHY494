Taking numerical derivatives is based on the elementary definition

$$
\frac{dy(t)}{dt} := \lim_{h\rightarrow 0} \frac{y(t+h) - y(t)}{h}
$$

We will then derive different finite difference approximations to the
derivative and assess their error.

## Class material

You can follow the lecture in the slides
[09-differentiation-theory.ipynb]({{ site.nbviewer.slides }}/09_differentiation/09-differentiation-theory.ipynb).

For the problem that you should solve during the class, accept the
GitHub Classroom
[Activity 11](https://github.com/ASU-CompMethodsPhysics-PHY494/Activity_11_differential_operators) via Canvas (or clone the repository
[ASU-CompMethodsPhysics-PHY494/Activity_11_differential_operators](https://github.com/ASU-CompMethodsPhysics-PHY494/Activity_11_differential_operators)). The
instructions are in the notebook [differentiation.ipynb]({{
site.org.url }}/Activity_11_differential_operators/blob/main/differentiation.ipynb).
