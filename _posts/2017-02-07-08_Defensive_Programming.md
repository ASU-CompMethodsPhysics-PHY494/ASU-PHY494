title: 08 Defensive Programming
---

**Note**: This lesson draws heavily from, and in some parts quotes directly,
the [Python Testing](http://katyhuff.github.io/python-testing/) lesson
developed by Kathryn Huff. 

Untested code is broken code. Doing science with untested code is akin to using
an experimental device that is uncalibrated, which is generally a bad idea.
The best way to write code that works and keeps on working is to assume it's
broken, and to build yourself some alarms for when its behavior is outside of
what is expected. 

This mindset is often called **defensive programming**.

In this lesson, we will learn about various flavors of testing code, including:

1. [Assertions](http://katyhuff.github.io/python-testing/02-assertions.html)
2. [Exceptions](http://katyhuff.github.io/python-testing/03-exceptions.html)
3. [Unit Tests](http://katyhuff.github.io/python-testing/04-units.html)

and we will write some of our own, too.
