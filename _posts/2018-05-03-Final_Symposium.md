title: Final Poster Symposium
---

Students worked on a **Final Project** in teams of two or three students and presented results as posters on 5/3/2018 in a conference-like setting, which we called the **Final Symposium**. Each student held a Q&A dicussion with the instructor in front of the poster.[^1]

Six teams looked at problems ranging from quantum mechanics to black holes. Each team started with a proposal, defined goals, and used computational techniques learned during the semester to achieve their goals:

The proposals, code, and the posters are available in the public GitHub repositories. Further details, including abstracts and licensing information, is available in the [Symposium Program (PDF)]({{site.baseurl}}/{{site.docs}}/program_symposium_2018.pdf).

#### Notes

[^1]: Each discussion was timed for 6 minutes and graded. Students
      were awarded a grade for their final that consisted of a grade
      for the whole project (collectively graded for the whole team)
      and the Q&A grade, which provides an individual component.

[^2]: The Poster Prize was awarded based on a vote by all
      participants. Winners received the recognition by their peers,
      and they also got fancy USB sticks to store a bootable Linux
      system on but winning the prize had no influence on the grade.
