title: 08 Errors

When working with numerical code, one has to be aware of the
limitations imposed by the
[representation of numbers in the computer]({{site.baseurl}}/{%
post_url 2020-02-20-07_Numbers %}) and the [numerical errors](#errors)
that algorithms invariably accumulate.



## Errors

Algorithms (especially those that involve floating point numbers)
generally accumulate errors. The key insight is that the total error
consists of an algorithmic error (also known as the *approximation
error*), which typically decreases with increasing the computational
cost and a *round-off error*, which increases with the number of
operations or the computational cost.
