After implementing a number of
[integrators for ODEs]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2018-02-20-10_ODEs
%}) we are now in the position to solve some practical problems:

- projectile movement with air resistance
- realistic movement of a spinning baseball

For the problem that you should solve during the class, get the
notebook[^1] 
[11-ODE-applications-students.ipynb]({{site.nbviewer.resources}}/11_ODE_applications/11-ODE-applications-students.ipynb)
and see 
notebook
[11-ODE-applications.ipynb]({{site.nbviewer.resources}}/11_ODE_applications/11-ODE-applications.ipynb)
for the full solution.[^2]

#### Footnotes



[^1]:

     As usual, `git pull` the resources repository
     [{{site.resources.shortname}}]({{site.resources.url}}) to get a
     local copy of the notebook. Then **copy the notebook and all other
     code into your work directory** in order to complete the exercises.

     Notebook will be posted after class; in the mean time look at the
     student notebook.
