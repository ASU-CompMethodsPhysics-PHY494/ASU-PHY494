title: 02 The first Python program
---

In your work directory, create a directory `~/PHY494/02_python` and go
to this directory:

{% highlight bash %}
mkdir ~/PHY494/02_python
cd ~/PHY494/02_python
{% endhighlight %}

# Hello World

Using you favorite editor, create a text file named `hello.py` with the
following content:

{% highlight python %}
# hello world in Python

name = input("What's your name? --> ")
print("Hello ", name, ", it's great to see you here.")
{% endhighlight %}

Execute ("run") your `hello.py` program with the `python` program:

{% highlight bash %}
python hello.py
{% endhighlight %}

# Python interpreter

Python is an interpreted language; you can think of `python` reading
each line in an input file and executing it. Start `python`

{% highlight bash %}
python
{% endhighlight %}

You should see something like

~~~~~
Python 3.5.2 |Anaconda 4.2.0 (x86_64)| (default, Jul  2 2016, 17:52:12)
[GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 4.2 (clang-425.0.28)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
~~~~

The Python prompt is `>>>`.

Type commands and execute them with Enter.

Like the shell, Python is a *REPL*, a "Read-eval-print-loop".

## Activity: hello, line by line

Type the commands from `hello.py` into the interpreter, hitting Enter
after every line, and execute your program step by step.

Exit with `quit()` or `Ctrl + d`

# Basic plotting

Create a file `motion.py` with content

{% highlight python %}
# plot motion with constant acceleration

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

a = 1.0    # acceleration
v0 = 0.0   # initial velocity

t, h, n = 0.0, 0.1, 20    # init time, step size, number of steps
ta, xa = [], []           # time and position lists

for i in range(n):
    x = v0*t + a*t*t/2.0
    ta.append(t)
    xa.append(x)
    t = t + h

# plot results
plt.figure(figsize=(4, 4))
plt.plot(ta, xa, '-o', color="red", linewidth=2)
plt.xlabel("t (s)")
plt.ylabel("x (m)")

plt.savefig("motion.png")
plt.show()
{% endhighlight %}

You should create a graph similar to the following:

![Constant accelleration plot]({{site.baseurl}}/{{site.figs}}/motion.png)

# Interactive Python with `ipython`

The [ipython](http://ipython.org) interpreter is like Python but with
*lots* of improvements such as `TAB`-completion, help with `command?`
(one question mark directly following a command) and source code with
`command??` (two question marks), commandline history, and many
additional shell-like commands (so-called "magic" commands such as
`%cd`, `%ls`, `%pwd`, `%run`, `%time` and `%timeit` --- see `%magic`
for help).

To exit, give the `exit()` command or `^D` (`Control` + `D`).

Just use `ipython` instead of `python` for interactive work.
