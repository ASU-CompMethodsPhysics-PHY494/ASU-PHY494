title: 02 The first Python program
---

In your work directory, create a directory `~/PHY494/02_python` and go
to this directory:

{% highlight bash %}
mkdir ~/PHY494/02_python
cd ~/PHY494/02_python
{% endhighlight %}

# Hello World

Using you favorite editor, create a text file named `hello.py` in the
directory `~/PHY494/02_python`[^1] with the
following content:

{% highlight python %}
# hello world in Python

name = input("What's your name? --> ")
print("Hello ", name, ", it's great to see you here.")
{% endhighlight %}

Execute ("run") your `hello.py` program with the `python` program:

{% highlight bash %}
python hello.py
{% endhighlight %}

# Python interpreter

[Python](https://www.python.org/) is an interpreted language; you can
think of `python` reading each line in an input file and executing
it. Start `python` on its own:

{% highlight bash %}
python
{% endhighlight %}

You should see something like

~~~~~
Python 3.5.2 |Anaconda 4.2.0 (x86_64)| (default, Jul  2 2016, 17:52:12)
[GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 4.2 (clang-425.0.28)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
~~~~

The Python prompt is `>>>`.

Type commands and execute them with Enter.

Like the shell, Python is a *REPL*, a "Read-eval-print-loop".

## Activity: hello, line by line

Type the commands from `hello.py` into the interpreter, hitting Enter
after every line, and execute your program step by step.

Exit with `quit()` or `Ctrl + d`

# Basic plotting

Create a file `motion.py` with content

{% highlight python %}
# plot motion with constant acceleration

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

a = 1.0    # acceleration
v0 = 0.0   # initial velocity

t, h, n = 0.0, 0.1, 20    # init time, step size, number of steps
ta, xa = [], []           # time and position lists

for i in range(n):
    x = v0*t + a*t*t/2.0
    ta.append(t)
    xa.append(x)
    t = t + h

# plot results
plt.figure(figsize=(4, 4))
plt.plot(ta, xa, '-o', color="red", linewidth=2)
plt.xlabel("t (s)")
plt.ylabel("x (m)")

plt.savefig("motion.png")
plt.show()
{% endhighlight %}

You should create a graph similar to the following:

![Constant accelleration plot]({{site.baseurl}}/{{site.figs}}/motion.png)

# Interactive Python with `ipython`

The [ipython](http://ipython.org) interpreter is like `python` but with
*lots* of improvements such as `TAB`-completion, help with `command?`
(one question mark directly following a command) and source code with
`command??` (two question marks), command line history, and many
additional shell-like commands (so-called "magic" commands such as
`%cd`, `%ls`, `%pwd`, `%run`, `%time` and `%timeit` --- see `%magic`
for help).

To exit, give the `exit()` command or `^D` (`Control` + `D`).

Just use `ipython` instead of `python` for interactive work.

#### Footnotes ####

[^1]:

    If you can call your editor from the command line then this is as
    easy as, for example with `nano` (or `vi`),

         cd ~/PHY494/02_python
	     nano hello.py

    This will open a new file with name `hello.py` or open an existing
    file if it is present.

    However, if you use an editor that you have to open from, say, the
    Windows Start menu, then you need to first open the editor and
    then use a menu command such as *File → New* to create a blank
    document (use or *File → Open* to open an existing file). Once you
    have written content you need to *save it in the correct location*
    (usually, or *File → Save*). To find the `02_python` directory,
    first navigate to your home directory:

	* This can be tricky on **Windows** : In your shell (not in your
      editor), type `cd; pwd` to learn the path to your home
      directory. In your editor's file system dialog window, start
      from the system disk (normally `C:` under *Computer*) and look
      for `C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME`.

	* On Apple **Mac OS X**, your home directory is
      `/Users/YOUR_USERNAME`.

	* On typical **Linux** distributions it is `/home/YOUR_USERNAME`.
	
    In your home directory, locate the `PHY494` folder, click on it to
    find the `02_python` folder inside and click on the
    latter. Provide the file name ("hello.py") and save the file. (In
    the shell, make sure that the file is in place where you expect it
    to be, i.e., `ls -la`.)
