title: Final Poster Symposium
---

Students worked on a **Final Project** in teams of two or three students and presented results as posters on 5/2/2019 in a conference-like setting, which we called the **Final Symposium**. Each student held a Q&A dicussion with the instructor in front of the poster.[^1]

Seven teams looked at problems ranging from quantum mechanics to self-driving cars and planetary movements.
Each team started with a proposal, defined goals, and used computational techniques learned during the semester to achieve their goals:

| #  | title  | team  |
|----|--------|-------|
| 1  | Path Integral Monte Carlo | @ctpeterson @ssuharto |
| 2  | Simulation of a NaCl | @logol7 @abgardn2 @sllake2  |
| 3  | Benzene simulation | @rsexton @jgens @nawtrey |
| 4  | Simulating JJ Thompson's Cathode Ray Tube Experiment | @agardeck @SNOlson |
| 5  | Agent-based modeling of self-driving cars | @wang-albert @dmlewis9 @nathanelmains |
| 6  | Jupiter's Trojan Asteroids | @MysticAhuacatl @jfmorga1 @abrahmbhASU |
| 7  | Examining solar system dynamics | @ShaneBechtel @KendricKnorr @Agherna8 |


The proposals, code, and the posters are available in the public GitHub repositories. Further details, including abstracts and licensing information, is available in the [Symposium Program (PDF)]({{site.baseurl}}/{{site.docs}}/program_symposium_2019.pdf).

The winner of the **Poster Prize** [^2] was team #6 with the project *Jupiter's Trojan Asteroids*:

#### Notes

[^1]: Each discussion was timed for 5 minutes and graded. Students
      were awarded a grade for their final that consisted of a grade
      for the whole project (collectively graded for the whole team)
      and the Q&A grade, which provides an individual component.

[^2]: The Poster Prize was awarded based on a vote by all
      participants. Winners received the recognition by their peers,
      and they also got lego Star Wars miniatures (but winning the prize had no influence on the grade).
