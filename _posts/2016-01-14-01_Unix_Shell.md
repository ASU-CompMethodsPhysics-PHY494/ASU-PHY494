title: 01 The Unix Shell
---

This lesson introduces the **shell**, also known as the **command
line**. There are many different shells: We are using the
**[bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell))** shell.

This lesson builds on [An Introduction to the command
line](http://becksteinlab.physics.asu.edu/learning/24/introduction-to-the-command-line)
with [Unix
Basics](http://becksteinlab.physics.asu.edu/pages/unix/IntroUnix/p01_UNIX.html)
and the [Software Carpentry lesson on The Unix
Shell](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/).

# Background and Motivation

As a computational scientist you have one primary tool at your hand: a
computer. And like an experimental scientist, you will have to be able
to interact with it, adjust it, tweak it, fix it, and generally make
it do things that it has never done before.

You are probably used to interacting with a computer via a graphical
user interface ("GUI") â€” windows, browsers, a mouse or touch
screen. Although convenient, this limits you to the interactions
designed into the interface. To get more out of a machine you have to
talk to it more directly.

We will interact with the computer using the text-based terminal
through a so-called *command line interface* (CLI). The user types
input commands; the commands are read, executed, and output is
printed. The program responsible for doing this is called the
**shell** (because it "encloses" the operating system to simplify user
interaction with it).

The shell is a program like any other but it's primary purpose is to
run other programs; most of the input "commands" are in fact other
programs. The shell is very good at working with the file system
(files and directories), combining multiple existing tools in powerful
ways, and automating tasks. On a
[Unix](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix)-like operating systems
(typically used for high-performance computing) using the shell is a
very powerful (and essential) way to interact with the computer.

# Tutorial

## Accessing the shell

* On a typical **Linux** system you open an application called
  *terminal* or *xterm* or *kterm* (or similar).

* On **Mac OS X** you open *Terminal.app* (in the *Utilities* folder in
  *Applications*).

* On Windows we use *Git Bash*: Find it in the Program menu under *All
  Programs/Git/Git Bash*

You should be greeted by the *prompt*, which can look like this

~~~
$
~~~

with the cursor as an underline or block showing that you can
type. Often your prompt is more elaborate, e.g.

~~~
dvader@deathstar.empire.gov  ~$
~~~

Type

{% highlight bash %}
whoami
{% endhighlight %}

and hit enter. You should see your username being printed to the
screen.

Type 

{% highlight bash %}
cd
{% endhighlight %}

and hit enter to begin the lesson. From now on, input will just be
shown and you should enter it.


## Navigating Files and Directories

### Commands
* `pwd` (print working directory)
* `ls` (list directory)
* `cd` (change directory)

Commands generally take *arguments* (what to operate on, required) and
*options* (modify the standard behavior, optional).

{% highlight bash %}
command_name -v -o optarg --long-opt  arg1 arg2
{% endhighlight %}

Often, omitting the argument also works and a default is assumed. You
can learn more about commands with the help function (try running just
with option `-h` or `--help` or on Linux/Mac OS X, `man command_name`;
the *Git Bash* installation does not come with man pages but you can
use services on the web such as the
[Debian man pages](http://manpages.debian.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi)).



### Paths

A *path* consists of *directory names* separated by forward-slashes
"`/`" and possibly a final *file name*. 

* `/` (the actual name of the "root" directory)
* `/home/dvader` or `/Users/dvader`
* `/usr/bin/nano`
* `books.txt`
* `/Users/dvader/Documents/deathstar/weaknesses.pdf`
* `Documents/deathstar/weaknesses.pdf`

Paths starting with `/` are called *absolute paths*; anything else is
a *relative* path, starting from the current working directory (check
with `pwd`).

### Moving around

Assume user dvader has the following directory layout in his *home
directory* `/Users/dvader`:

~~~
/Users/dvader/
	     Documents/
		      deathstar/
			       weaknesses.pdf
			       electrical_bill.dat
		      work/
	     data/
		 planets.dat
		 bases
~~~
                      
If he executes the `cd` command

{% highlight bash %}
cd /Users/dvader/Documents/deathstar
{% endhighlight %}

then he will have moved to the `deathstar` directory.

The `cd` command took an *argument*, the directory to go to.

{% highlight bash %}
pwd
{% endhighlight %}

will print

~~~
/Users/dvader/Documents/deathstar
~~~
{: .output}

If he runs

{% highlight bash %}
ls
{% endhighlight %}

he will see 

~~~ 
electrical_bill.dat  weaknesses.pdf
~~~
{: .output}

In order to get to the `data` directory he could use the command `cd
/Users/dvader/data` but instead he uses the *special directory* `..`
(which means "the directory above this one"):

{% highlight bash %}
cd ../../data
{% endhighlight %}

(Use the `TAB` key while typing: *autocompletion* is one of the best
features of the shell! The other great interactive feature is the
history: try using the cursor-up and -down keys.)

A second special directory is `.` ("this directory"). `.` and `..`
are understood by all commands.

### Activity

1. What does the following sequence of commands show?

        cd
        ls -a

2. Go to the `bin` directory that is located in the `usr` directory,
   which itself is located in the root directory. List the files
   there. Did you find "nano" and "grep"?
3. What does `ls -R /usr` show? (Try `^C`...)
4. Try other options of `ls` such as `-sh` or `-sha`. --- ask `ls` for
   help!
5. Is there a difference between `ls -sha`, `ls -ash`, and `ls -a -s
   -h`?



### Tips to make your life easy

* Use the shell's convenience features:
  * `TAB` completion 
  * up/down arrow to get commands that you already typed. 
  * `history` shows all the commands you typed so far
  * Try out `Control`+`R` (`^R`) to search through your shell
    *history*.
  * `^A` and `^E` will likely take you to the beginning and end of a
    line
* Use `cd ..` to go up, `cd ../..` to go up twice etc.
* Use `cd -` to go to *the previous directory I was in* (only works
  for `cd`).
* Use the tilde character `~` for your home directory, e.g. `cd
  ~/Documents` is equivalent to `cd /Users/dvader/Documents`.


## Copy, rename, delete

### Commands

* `mkdir` (make directory)
* `cp` (copy file, `cp -r` copy recursively, including directories)
* `mv` (move, i.e. rename)
* `rmdir` (remove empty directory)
* `rm` (remove file, `rm -r` remove recursively (**dangerous!**))

### Directory structure for the class

Make a directory `PHY494` in your home directory for the class and
inside it, one called `01_shell` for today's lesson:

{% highlight bash %}
cd ~
mkdir PHY494
cd PHY494
mkdir 01_shell
{% endhighlight %}

Note: 

* *Avoid spaces and most special characters in file names.* All
  letters and numbers together with underscore `_`, minus sign `-`,
  and period `.` are ok.
* Plain `mkdir` cannot create multiple directories deep in one go
  unless you have the `-p` option (check!).

### Activity

1. Inside your `01_shell` directory, create three directories, `data`
   and `Documents/work`.
2. Go to `Documents/work`

### Creating text files with a text editor

Run `nano`:
{% highlight bash %}
nano
{% endhighlight %}

You should see something like this:

![Nano screenshot]({{site.baseurl}}/{{site.figs}}/nano.png)

(Note: for real work use a more powerful editor such as
[Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) or
[Vim](http://www.vim.org/) (both of which come with a steep learning
curve), or a graphical editor such as
[Gedit](http://projects.gnome.org/gedit/). On Windows, a free editor is
[Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/).)

Create a todo list with content

    Plan for today:

    1. find rebel base
    2. destroy!

Save it to file 'TODO' with the command `^O` and type the file name
`TODO` and exit with `^X`. Check that the file is there with `ls`.

### Activity

1. Make a backup (call it `TODO.bak`) of the TODO list with the `cp`
   command.
2. Rename `TODO` to `TODO.txt` with the `mv` command.
3. Make a directory `notes` under the `data` directory: You should now
   have a directory tree similar to

        ~/PHY494/01_shell/
                          Documents/
                                    work/
                                         TODO.txt
                                         TODO.bak
                          data/
                              notes/

   Check with `ls -R ~/PHY494`.
4. Put a copy of `TODO.txt` into the `notes` directory (using `cp`).
5. Create a new text file `data/notes/hints.txt` and write any
   [hints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_planet)  for possible
   rebel bases into this file.
6. Open `TODO.txt` in `nano` and add a note to item 1 too look in the
   hints.txt file. Save and exit.
7. Make a copy of your `notes` directory in your work directory:

        ~/PHY494/01_shell/
                          Documents/
                                    work/
                                         TODO.txt
                                         TODO.bak
                                         notes/
                                              TODO.txt
                                              hints.txt
                          data/
                              notes/
                                    TODO.txt
                                    hints.txt

8. Remove `data/notes/hints.txt` with `rm`.
9. Remove `data/notes` with `rmdir`. (Hint: Read the error message!)
10. Move `work/notes/hints.txt` into the `work` directory.
11. Remove the useless `work/notes` directory with `rm -r` (careful !)

**WARNING: There is no "Trashcan" or built in backup. Once you `rm`
something, it is gone.** Be especially careful with `rm -r`.

Note: all these commands can also work on multiple filenames.

## Pipes and Filters

### Commands

* `cat`
* `head`
* `tail`
* `less`
* `wc`
* `sort`
* `uniq`
* `cut` and `paste`
* `grep`

and special shell characters

* `|` ("pipe", joins commands together)
* `>` (redirects output to a file)
* `<` (redirects file to input)

### Working with redirection and command pipelines

Download [planets.dat]({{ site.baseurl }}/{{ site.data }}/planets.dat)
and put it in the directory `data/`. You can do this with your web
browser or if you have the `curl` program installed, try 

{% highlight bash %}
curl {{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/{{site.data}}/planets.dat -O
{% endhighlight %}

(all on one line).

Output the whole file to the screen:

{% highlight bash %}
cat planets.dat
{% endhighlight %}

Make a file in which all planets are duplicated:

{% highlight bash %}
cat planets.dat planets.dat > planets_2.dat
{% endhighlight %}


Look at the first three lines of the file

{% highlight bash %}
head -3 planets.dat
{% endhighlight %}

should give

~~~
Alderaan             12500  grasslands/mountains
Yavin_IV             10200  jungle/rainforests
Hoth                  7200  tundra/icecaves/mountainranges
~~~
{: .output}

Count the number of planets

{% highlight bash %}
wc planets.dat
{% endhighlight %}

~~~
      60     180    2944 planets.dat
~~~
{: .output}


#### Activity

1. Test `wc -l` gives just the number of lines ("60").
2. What does `wc planets.dat planets_2.dat` do?
3. What happens when you do `wc < planets.dat`?
4. Run `wc` then type any number of lines of text (pressing enter
   to terminate each line) and when you get bore, press `^D`
   (control+D). What happened?

#### Pipes

Sort by name and look at the first five using a **pipes** and
**filters**:

{% highlight bash %}
sort planets.dat | head -5
{% endhighlight %}

Sort by diameter (column 2), biggest first, and write the top 3 to a
file `biggest_planets`:

{% highlight bash %}
sort -k2,2 -n planets.dat | head -5 > biggest_planets
{% endhighlight %}

Count the number of planets with unknown diameter:

{% highlight bash %}
grep "unknown" planets.dat | wc -l
{% endhighlight %}

Get the first letter of each planet name and sort alphabetically:

{% highlight bash %}
cut -b 1,1 planets.dat | sort
{% endhighlight %}

Get the terrain types

{% highlight bash %}
cut -b 29-  planets.dat
{% endhighlight %}

### Activity

1. Count the number of planets in `planets_2.dat`.
2. Find planets where the rebel might have a base (hint: you know it's
   cold there... use `grep`). How many planets will you investigate
   more closely? Write the list to the file `bases`.
3. How many *unique* terrain types are there? (Hint: `uniq` needs a
   sorted list as input)
4. What is the most frequent and the least frequent first letter
   amongst these planets? (Hint: `uniq -c`)


### Shell glob patterns

Use the character `*` to match "any part of a file name", e.g.

{% highlight bash %}
ls *.dat
{% endhighlight %}

will list all files ending in `.dat`.

The `?` character matches a single character. Neither of them matches
a leading `.` in a file name or a space.


## Using `git` to get data for the class ##

`git` is a version control software and we will come back to explain
its main functionality later. Right now we use it as a convenient tool
to get additional data. 

There is a "repository" at
<https://github.com/ASU-CompMethodsPhysics-PHY494/PHY494-resources>
that contains data and code to be used during the class. It will be
updated as we go along.

Get the data for today by **cloning** the repository:

~~~
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/ASU-CompMethodsPhysics-PHY494/PHY494-resources.git
~~~

(You only need to do this *once*.)

At any later time, **pull** in the latest updates from inside the
repository::

~~~
cd PHY494-resources
git pull
~~~

(This can be done as often as you like.)

Go into the `PHY494-resources/01_shell/data` directory.

### Activity

1. Read the `README` file (e.g. using `nano` or `cat` or `less` (for
the latter, use `h` to get help and `q` to quit)).

2. Count the number of entries in *all files ending in "csv"*. (Hint:
use a glob pattern)

3. Use `cut -f 1  -d ',' people.csv` to extract each name to a file
`names` and a similar command to extract weight to a file `weights`.

4. Use the `paste` command to generate a new list that contains
   "weight name" (reordered and separated by space):

        paste weights names

   Use this approach to sort the people in order of decreasing weight.

## Shell scripts

You can save commands in a file. This is called a **script**.

Make directory for your scripts `~/bin`.

Using`nano`, create the following script `~/bin/update_resources.sh`:

{% highlight bash %}
# PHY 494 script to update the resources repository

GIT_REPOSITORY="${HOME}/PHY494-resources"

cd "${GIT_REPOSITORY}"
git pull

echo "Updated resources in ${GIT_REPOSITORY}"
{% endhighlight %}

Execute the script with

{% highlight bash %}
bash ~/bin/update_resources.sh
{% endhighlight %}

Notes:

* The line starting with `#` is a *comment*: it is not a shell command
  and is ignored by the shell. However, adding comments to scripts is
  **a really, really good idea!**

* The shell has **variables**: Some like `HOME` are pre-defined,
  others you can define yourself (`GIT_REPOSITORY=...`). Using
  all-caps is a convention that you should follow.

  The contents (value) of variables is accessed with the dollar `$`
  sign in front of the variable name.

* `echo` prints to the standard output (typically, the screen)
