title: 01 The Unix Shell
---

This lesson introduces the **shell**, also known as the **command
line**. There are many different shells: We are using the
**[bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell))** shell.

This lesson builds on [An Introduction to the command
line](http://becksteinlab.physics.asu.edu/learning/24/introduction-to-the-command-line)
with [Unix
Basics](http://becksteinlab.physics.asu.edu/pages/unix/IntroUnix/p01_UNIX.html)
and the [Software Carpentry lesson on The Unix
Shell](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/).

## Background and Motivation

As a computational scientist you have one primary tool at your hand: a
computer. And like an experimental scientist, you will have to be able
to interact with it, adjust it, tweak it, fix it, and generally make
it do things that it has never done before.

You are probably used to interacting with a computer via a graphical
user interface ("GUI") â€” windows, browsers, a mouse or touch
screen. Although convenient, this limits you to the interactions
designed into the interface. To get more out of a machine you have to
talk to it more directly.

We will interact with the computer using the text-based terminal
through a so-called *command line interface* (CLI). The user types
input commands; the commands are read, executed, and output is
printed. The program responsible for doing this is called the
**shell** (because it "encloses" the operating system to simplify user
interaction with it).

The shell is a program like any other but it's primary purpose is to
run other programs; most of the input "commands" are in fact other
programs. The shell is very good at working with the file system
(files and directories), combining multiple existing tools in powerful
ways, and automating tasks. On a
[Unix](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix)-like operating systems
(typically used for high-performance computing) using the shell is a
very powerful (and essential) way to interact with the computer.

## Tutorial

### Accessing the shell

* On a typical **Linux** system you open an application called
  *terminal* or *xterm* or *kterm* (or similar).

* On **Mac OS X** you open *Terminal.app* (in the *Utilities* folder in
  *Applications*).

* On Windows we use *Git Bash*: Find it in the Program menu under *All
  Programs/Git/Git Bash*

You should be greeted by the *prompt*, which can look like this

~~~
$
~~~

with the cursor as an underline or block showing that you can
type. Often your prompt is more elaborate, e.g.

~~~
dvader@deathstar.empire.gov  ~$
~~~

Type

{% highlight bash %}
whoami
{% endhighlight %}

and hit enter. You should see your username being printed to the
screen.

Type 

{% highlight bash %}
cd
{% endhighlight %}

and hit enter to begin the lesson. From now on, input will just be
shown and you should enter it.
