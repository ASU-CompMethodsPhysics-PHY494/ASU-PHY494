title: 06 Differentiation
---

Taking numerical derivatives is based on the elementary definition

$$
\frac{dy(t)}{dt} := \lim_{h\rightarrow 0} \frac{y(t+h) - y(t)}{h}
$$

We will then derive different finite difference approximations to the
derivative and assess their error.

You can follow the lecture in the slides
[06_differentiation.ipynb](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/format/slides/github/ASU-CompMethodsPhysics-PHY494/PHY494-resources/blob/master/06_differentiation/06_differentiation.ipynb).

For the problem that you should solve during the class, get the
notebook
