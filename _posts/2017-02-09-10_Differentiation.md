title: 10 Differentiation
---

Taking numerical derivatives is based on the elementary definition

$$
\frac{dy(t)}{dt} := \lim_{h\rightarrow 0} \frac{y(t+h) - y(t)}{h}
$$

We will then derive different finite difference approximations to the
derivative and assess their error.

## Class material

You can follow the lecture in the slides
[10-differentiation.ipynb]({{site.nbviewer.resources}}/10_differentiation/10-differentiation-part-1.ipynb).
[^1]

For the problem that you should solve during the class, get the
notebook
[10-differentiation-students.ipynb]({{site.nbviewer.resources}}/10_differentiation/10-differentiation-students.ipynb)
(`git pull` [your PHY494-resources repository]({{site.baseurl}}{%
post_url 2017-01-24-04_Git_basics %}#class-resources-on-github)).

    The notebook is not complete yet ("part 1"); the full notebook
    will be posted *after* the student exercise
    [10-differentiation-students.ipynb]({{site.nbviewer.resources}}/10_differentiation/10-differentiation-students.ipynb)
    has been completed.
