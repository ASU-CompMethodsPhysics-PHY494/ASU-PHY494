title:  02 Git Basics
---

This is a short introduction to one of the most essential tools in
software development: a
[version control system](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/reference#version-control)
and in particular the [Git](https://git-scm.com/) tool.[^0]

A **version control system** (VCS) manages files and tracks changes to
those files. It stores the complete **history** and allows you to
recover files at any stage of the history (think "undo" to the
beginning). Any serious software project uses version control but its
uses go beyond software, e.g., documents and data can also be version
controlled.

![PhD Comics: "FINAL".doc (c) 2012 Jorge Charm](http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive/phd101212s.gif)

A set of changes is called a **commit**. It typically contains changes
to multiple files. It also contains a timestamp, information about
the user who made the changes, and a **commit message** that explains the
changes. The history consists of all the commits. The VCS stores the
history in a storage area called a **repository**.

![Illustration of branches, merging, and multiple revisions in
git. (Source: https://git-scm.com/)](https://git-scm.com/images/branching-illustration@2x.png)

Modern distributed VCS such as *Git* or *mercurial* make it easy for
multiple developers to work on the same project. They have support for
**merging changes** from different people into a single new file, and
for **resolving conflicts**, i.e., the case when the same part of a
file was changed (the changes "collided"). Online platforms such as
[GitHub](https://github.com), [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/), or
[GitLab](https://gitlab.com/explore) provide free repositories in the
cloud (but you don't need these platforms to use a VCS!).

We will use [Git](https://git-scm.com/). For the class you should get
into the habit to version-control your work: in class notes, home
works, and projects. You will use GitHub to submit code that you
develop as part of your assignments and projects.

2. [Set up your own GitHub repositories](#set-up-your-own-github-repositories)
3. [Class resources on GitHub](#class-resources-on-github)
4. [Additional resources](#more)

## Tutorial
Let's use `git` to manage what we have done so far.

If you want to read more about *Git*, have a look at the free [Pro Git
Book](https://git-scm.com/book) by Scott Chacon and Ben Straub and see
the [other resources](#more).

### Configuring Git ###

The first time you use `git` you need to tell it who you are: this
information will be the user information in the commit history. 
#### Personalization

Set your name and email. 

Use a name and email address that can appear in the clear in the world
because you will also use it to sign up and access the
[GitHub](https://github.com/) web site; if you are concerned about
privacy, please review [GitHub’s instructions for keeping your email
address
private](https://help.github.com/articles/keeping-your-email-address-private/). During
this class we will use GitHub all the time:

* Homework will be submitted to *private* git repositories (only
  visible to you and the instructors).
* Projects will be submitted to *private* repositories only visible to
  you, your team, and the instructors.
* The final project can be submitted to a *public* repository,
  visible to everyone in the world (e.g., to use it as part of a portfolio)

Set the name and email associated with your commits (*Use your own
name and email address!*) (and how to color output):

{% highlight bash %}
git config --global user.name "Darth Vader"
git config --global user.email "dvader@empire.gov"
git config --global color.ui "auto"
{% endhighlight %}


There are subtle differences between how Windows and Linux/macOS treat
line endings, which matters for programming. [Without going into
details](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/02-setup/), please
set the following

On **Windows**
{% highlight bash %}
git config --global core.autocrlf true
{% endhighlight %}

On **macOS** or **Linux**
{% highlight bash %}
git config --global core.autocrlf input
{% endhighlight %}



You can see a list of all your configuration settings with `git config
--list`.

#### Git Editor

You also tell what editor to use to write commit messages [^1]; here
we configure [atom to be used with git](https://help.github.com/articles/associating-text-editors-with-git/). 

##### Windows

{% highlight bash %}
# choose atom as your editor: Windows
git config --global core.editor "C:/Users/USERNAME/AppData/Local/atom/bin/atom.cmd --wait"
{% endhighlight %}

where `USERNAME` should be your username. Double check that the path
`/c/Users/USERNAME/AppData/Local/atom/bin/atom.cmd` really points to
the `atom` command. (You can try the command `which atom`, which might
show you the correct path on your computer.) Otherwise, add the correct path. Ask for help if
necessary.


#####  macOS and Linux
{% highlight bash %}
# choose atom as your editor: Linux and Mac
git config --global core.editor "atom --wait"
{% endhighlight %}


#### `git` basic command syntax

Git commands always follow the pattern 

    git <verb> [options] [arguments ...]
	
In particular, `--help` is always an option. Also
try `git help` and `git help tutorial`.


### Creating a repository ###

A repository starts from a directory with files.

#### Create your `~/PHY494` directory ####

During the class you will work on programs. Make a directory
`~/PHY494` where you will do your work:
{% highlight bash %}
mkdir ~/PHY494
{% endhighlight %}
Create subdirectories for lessons:
{% highlight bash %}
cd ~/PHY494
mkdir 01_shell 02_git
{% endhighlight %}

If you have done the [shell exercises]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url
2021-01-14-01_Unix_Shell
%}#activity-directory-structure-for-the-class) then your PHY494 might
now look like the following:

~~~
~/PHY494/
  ├── 01_shell
  │   ├── Documents
  │   │   └── work
  │   │       ├── TODO
  │   │       └── lesson
  │   └── data
  └── 02_git
~~~

Create a `README.md` file in `01_shell` and `02_git` with [your
editor]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2021-01-14-01_Unix_Shell
%}#creating-text-files-with-a-text-editor) that contains text like the
following:
{% highlight markdown %}
# 01 Shell

Work with the `bash` shell.
{% endhighlight %}
and
{% highlight markdown %}
# 02 git

Working with the `git` *version control software*; see https://git-scm.com/.
{% endhighlight %}
(or write whatever you want — the exact content is not
important). Also create a file `~/01_shell/hello.sh` with content
{% highlight markdown %}
# simple bash script example
echo "Hello World!"
{% endhighlight %}

Your directory structure should now have two `README.md` files and `hello.sh` (you can
use `ls -R ~/PHY494` to check):

~~~
~/PHY494/
  ├── 01_shell
  │   ├── Documents
  │   │   └── work
  │   │       ├── TODO
  │   │       └── lesson
  │   ├── README.md        <---- should be present
  │   ├── hello.sh         <---- should be present
  │   └── data
  └── 02_git
      └── README.md        <---- should be present
~~~

#### `git init` ####

Turn the `PHY494` directory into **repository** with the `git init` command:

{% highlight bash %}
cd ~/PHY494
git init
{% endhighlight %}

That's it. Although, not much happened yet... except, check with

{% highlight bash %}
ls -la
{% endhighlight %}

A new hidden directory `~/PHY494/.git/` appeared. This is your actual
repository (or database) where Git stores all its information. **Do
not change anything in this directory** (unless you really know what
you are doing) and **do not delete the `.git`** directory. If you
delete it, your repository is irrevocably gone (and there is no undo
for that!).

Now try the (possibly) most-used git command:

{% highlight bash %}
git status
{% endhighlight %}

which gives
~~~
On branch master

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	01_shell/
	02_git/
~~~

... but what does it mean? For this
[gobbledygook](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/gobbledygook)
to make sense we need to know about *the three stages of git*:


### The three states of Git ###

For Git, a file can reside in one of *three states*

- **Modified** means that you have changed the file but have not
  committed it to your database yet; the file is in the **working directory**. 
- **Staged** means that you have marked a modified file in its current
  version to go into your next commit snapshot; it lives in the
  **staging area** [^5].
- **Committed** means that the data is safely stored in your local
  database (the **git repository** in the `.git` directory).

![Git working tree, Staging Area, and repository (database). (Source: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/images/areas.png)

The *basic Git workflow*:
1. modify files in working directory
2. selectively stage changes that you want to include in your next
   commit (adds only those files to the staging area)
3. commit your changes (takes files from the staging area and stores
   them permanently in your Git repository)


### Adding files ###

Prepare the modified files to be committed to the repository: `git
add` adds files and directories to the *staging area*:


{% highlight bash %}
git add 02_git 01_shell/hello.sh
git status
{% endhighlight %}


Add more files and directories:
{% highlight bash %}
git add 01_shell
git status
{% endhighlight %}


(Use `git reset FILENAME` to unstage any files that you might have
added accidentally. For instance, do not add backup files that were
created by your editor.)

The files are not committed yet. You can do more work, add more files
and directories...


### Committing ###
Check-in (or **commit**) your changes to your git repository:

{% highlight bash %}
git commit
{% endhighlight %}

* When your editor pops up, enter a **commit message**: Convention:
  - first line (<60 char): one line summary
  - second line: blank
  - third and following lines: more details
  The first line is mandatory (you cannot have a commit without a
  message), the rest is optional. *The commit message should
  succinctly summarize the changes in the commit.*
  
  As an example, the following would make a good message:
  
  ~~~
  initial commit of PHY494 class work
  
  * lesson 01 on shell
  * lesson 02 on git
  ~~~
  
* After you wrote and saved the message ("save" in `atom`, `^O` in
  `nano`; `i` to write and `ESC :wq` to save and exit in `vim`) and
  exited ("quit" in `atom`, `^X` in `nano`), your changes will be
  committed to the repository.
* You can also supply the message as an argument: `git commit -m "one
  line summary of changes"`.
* **If you are having problems to make `git commit` with your editor
  work** then instead use `git commit -m 'one line summary message'`
  and debug this problem later.[^1]
* Check the status with `git status`...

For a new commit, [add files](#adding-files) and [commit](#committing)
again.

For good measure:
{% highlight bash %}
git commit
{% endhighlight %}
should show that you have no uncommited changes in your working directory.

### History

Git stores complete snapshots of your working tree in the repository:
each version (or commit) can be used to recreate an exact state of all
your files:

![Git checkins over time are snapshots of the WHOLE project. (Source: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/images/snapshots.png)


Read the history with

{% highlight bash %}
git log
{% endhighlight %}



### Removing and renaming files

Removing files and directories via git allows you to get them back later.

{% highlight bash %}
git rm FILENAME
git rm -r DIRECTORY
{% endhighlight %}

Renaming is the same as removing the old file and adding the new one
but there is also a simple command

{% highlight bash %}
git mv OLD NEW
{% endhighlight %}

The `git rm` and `git mv` commands are similar to the `git add`
command in that they stage these changes; you still have to
[commit](#committing) them.


### Working with remote repositories

Repositories can live in your local file system or remotely on another
server ("in the cloud"). Git provides a way to synchronize local and
remote repositories.

There's nothing special about remote repositories. They do not really
differ from your local repository. Git is a *distributed version
control system* and any repository holds all the relevant history.

There exist many services that host remote repositories "in the
cloud". One of them is [GitHub](https://github.com) (which we use for
this class).[^7]


#### Initializing from remote: `git clone`

To initialize a local repository from a remote source we use `git clone`:

{% highlight bash %}
git clone URL
{% endhighlight %}

For instance, let's clone the class repository where code and data
will be posted by the instructor:

{% highlight bash %}
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/ASU-CompMethodsPhysics-PHY494/PHY494-resources.git
cd PHY494-resources
{% endhighlight %}

Note:

* The local name of your repository can be any name you like but it is
  customary (and less confusing) if you go with the default, which is
  the remote repository name without the ".git" suffix, i.e.,
  *PHY494-resources* for us.
* For all other `git` commands you *must* be *inside* your local
  repository:

      cd ~/PHY494-resources


#### Getting changes (reading): `git pull`

Update your local repository with any "upstream" changes by
**pulling** from the remote repository:

{% highlight bash %}
git pull
{% endhighlight %}

#### Updating the remote (writing): `git push`

If one has write access to a remote repository then one can also
update the remote repository with local changes (commits) by
**pushing** all commits that the local repository has:

{% highlight bash %}
git push
{% endhighlight %}

(This will *not* work for *PHY494-resources* because only instructors
have write access but we will use it below for [your own GitHub
repositories](#set-up-your-own-github-repositories)).



## Set up your own GitHub repositories

1. Go to <https://github.com> and create a new account. It is
   free.[^2] Remember your
   GitHub **username** and the **password**.
2. Create a new repository *PHY494* (do not initialize it with a
   README or other file)
3. Note the repository URL
   https://github.com/USERNAME/PHY494.git
4. Add the remote repository to your local repository `~/PHY494`
   (replace *USERNAME* with your GitHub username):

        git remote add origin https://github.com/USERNAME/PHY494.git

   We named the remote "origin", which is a common choice for the main
   repository. You can have many different remotes, just give them
   different names. You can list them with

        git remote -v

5. Traditionally, git used the name "master" for the main branch of
   the work. However, this name is falling rapidly out of favor so we
   rename our branch to "main":

        git branch -M main

   (You only have to do this once.)

5. **push** your local history to the remote repository:

       git push --set-upstream origin main

   You need to enter your username and password [^3].

   You only need the `--set-upstream origin main` (or `-u origin
   main`) for the first time (it tells git which "branches" to
   associate with each other in local and remote) [^4]. All further
   push operations will then simply be

       git push

   Look at the web interface at
   https://github.com/USERNAME/PHY494 and see your changes
   appear.

For the rest of the semester, commit what you did during each class
session to the `~/PHY494` repository on your laptop (and also push
to your GitHub repository as a backup).

**Note**: Your GitHub repository is for in-class work. Do not commit homeworks
there; you will receive *private* repositories for the duration of the
class for this purpose.


## PHY494 Workflow: Resources and Workspace

Code, notebooks, and files are being made available on GitHub in the
**resources** repository
[ASU-CompMethodsPhysics-PHY494/PHY494-resources](https://github.com/ASU-CompMethodsPhysics-PHY494/PHY494-resources).
For the rest of the semester it will be assumed that you have a
`~/PHY494-resources` repository that you can update with a simple `git
pull` as soon as new material is posted.

If you have not done so already, set up `~/PHY494-resources`:

{% highlight bash %}
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/ASU-CompMethodsPhysics-PHY494/PHY494-resources.git
{% endhighlight %}

You should also [have your own **workspace** repository `~/PHY494` set
up](#set-up-your-own-github-repositories).
 
### Overview

When we start a new lesson you will typically go through the following steps to
get code and data files.

1. pull latest changes from PHY494-resources
2. copy the new directories and files into your workspace PHY494
3. work in your workspace
4. commit changes in your workspace
5. (optional) push changes in your workspace your GitHub repository

### Update resources ("pull resources")

Update when your instructor changed anything on the remote:

{% highlight bash %}
cd ~/PHY494-resources
git pull
{% endhighlight %}

Check what's new
{% highlight bash %}
ls -lt
{% endhighlight %}
(newest at top)

### Copy new files and directories to workspace ("copy resources")

You should not be changing anything inside `~/PHY494-resources`
(because the next `git pull` might try to change something that you
did [^6]) but instead *copy* whatever you want to change to your own work
directory.

For example:

{% highlight bash %}
cp -r ~/PHY494-resources/00_setup ~/PHY494
cd ~/PHY494/00_setup
{% endhighlight %}


{% comment %}
For example, in the
Fix as many bugs as possible! challenge you
would copy all the `bugs_*.py` files to your own `~/PHY494` repo and
work there:

{% highlight bash %}
cp -r ~/PHY494-resources/05_debugging ~/PHY494
cd ~/PHY494/05_debugging
{% endhighlight %}

{% endcomment %}


### Work, commit, push
Then work on the files **in the workspace**.

When you have changes that you want to track, `git add /
commit / push`:
{% highlight bash %}
git add .
git commit -m 'updated 00 setup files'
git push
{% endhighlight %}


## Contributing to Open Source on GitHub

[GitHub](https://github.com) is a provider for remote repositories. It
enables you to easily contribute to other projects. This includes

* filing bug reports or feature requests (*raising issues*); for
  instance, if you do not agree with some of the Star Wars data from
  the previous lessons, raise an issue in the
  [issue tracker for the PHY494-auxilliary repository](https://github.com/ASU-CompMethodsPhysics-PHY494/PHY494-auxilliary/issues).
* proposing to add your own code and changes through
  *[pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)*
  (but this is too advanced for a our short introduction today --- see
  the additional resources under [More...](#more)).

     An unlimited number of *public* (i.e., visible for everyone)
     repositories are free on GitHub but private repositories cost
     money. However, if you use your school email address
     (e.g. @asu.edu) you can also get private
     repositories for free through the
     [GitHub educational
    discount](https://help.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-billing-and-payments-on-github/discounted-subscriptions-for-github-accounts);
    see also the [GitHub Education](https://education.github.com/) site.
	 
[^3]:

     There are ways to set up remote repositories so that you don't
     have to provide username and password for every push and which
     are also more secure. Namely one can use SSH keys instead of the
     HTTPS protocol, as described in the GitHub tutorial on
     [Generating SSH keys](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/).

[^4]:

    *Branching* is a more advanced topic, which is explained in the
    materials linked under [More...](#more). We barely scratched the
    surface of Git but this will be sufficient to already make good
    use of this very powerful tool.

[^5]:

    Technically, the *staging area* (or *index*) is also located in
    the `.git` directory but that is not really
    relevant. Conceptually, the staging area is different from the Git
    repository. See more in Git Pro under [Gettings Started – Git
	Basics](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Git-Basics).
	
[^6]:

    If you happen to have accidentally edited files inside
    `~/PHY494-resources` you might run into *merge conflicts* when you
    run `git pull` the next time. If that happens, copy *all files
    that you edited* (use `git status` to see which ones are modified)
    to a safe directory and then reset with the command

        cd ~/PHY494-resources
        # Next command only if you ran into a merge conflict
        # during a 'git pull'
        git merge --abort
        
        # undo ALL of YOUR changes
        git reset --hard HEAD

    **WARNING**: This will undo *all your changes* but will allow you to
    just run the next `git pull` command again without problems.
