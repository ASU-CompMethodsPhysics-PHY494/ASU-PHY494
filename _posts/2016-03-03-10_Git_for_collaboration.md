title: 10 Git for Collaboration 
---

For the
[Midterm Project](https://github.com/ASU-CompMethodsPhysics-PHY494/Midterm_Project)
you are collaborating as a team of three students. You will share one
Git repository on GitHub.

## Merging

For testing, we will use the *sandbox* repository: Clone it

{% highlight bash %}
git clone https://github.com/ASU-CompMethodsPhysics-PHY494/sandbox.git
cd sandbox
{% endhighlight %}

and then follow the instructor's lead.


## Communication

See
[MidtermMeeting.pdf]({{site.baseurl}}/{{site.lectures}}/MidtermMeeting.pdf)
for more details on the following:

* Create a wiki for your repository and use it to document your plans.
* Use the issue tracker to keep track of what you need to fix and for
  discussions.
* Optional: use [Gitter](https://gitter.im) for chat
