title: 17 PDEs: Wave equation
---

The wave equation is a hyperbolic
[partial differential equations (PDEs)]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url
2017-03-30-15_PDEs %}) which describes the displacement $$y(x,t)$$ as
a function of position and time. The 1D linear wave equation is

$$
\frac{\partial^2 y(x, t)}{\partial x^2} = \frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial^2 y(x, t)}{\partial t^2}
$$


and it depends on both space and time derivatives.


## Leap frog algorithm for solving the wave equation

We can then transform the PDE into a finite difference equation on a
$$\Delta x, \Delta t$$ lattice. The difference equation can be solved
with a **time stepping scheme** where we start from the initial values
and solve the spatial component for increasing times $$t = \Delta t,
2\Delta t, 3\Delta t, \dots$$ using an explicit method such as
the *Leapfrog algorithm*, similar to the
[solution for the heat equation]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url
2017-04-13-16_PDEs_Time_Stepping %}).

## Von Neumann stability analysis

Not all combinations of $$\Delta t$$ and $$\Delta x$$ lead to stable
solutions. Using *von Neumann stability analysis* one can determine
analytically the relationship between the discretizations in space and
time that lead to stable solutions. The analysis is based on
determining the stable eigenmodes of the finite difference equation,
i.e., we determine the conditions under which no modes grow in
time. This then implies that solutions, which can be written as linear
superpositions of these eigenmodes, will also not grow in time and are
therefore stable.

For the wave equation the **Courant condition** follows

$$
c \le \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}
$$

or when written as

$$
\Delta t \le \frac{\Delta x}{c}
$$

it means that the time step $$\Delta t$$ (for a given $$\Delta x$$)
must be *smaller than the time that the wave takes to travel one grid
step*.
