title: special Random Walk

## Random walk
A random walk is a mathematical object, known as a stochastic 
or random process, that describes a path that consists of a 
succession of random steps on some mathematical space such 
as the integers.

A popular random walk model is that of a random walk on a 
regular lattice, where at each step the location jumps to 
another site according to some probability distribution. 
In a simple random walk, the location can only jump to 
neighboring sites of the lattice, forming a lattice path. 
In simple symmetric random walk on a locally finite 
lattice, the probabilities of the location jumping to 
each one of its immediate neighbors are the same.[^0]

Today, we are going to use numpy package to implement the
 1D(example), 2D(skeleton and solutions) random walk models.


## Class material

The class will be live-coded in a Jupyter notebook. 

You can load the notebook yourself: first update your local
[PHY494-resources repository]({{site.resources.url}})[^1]

{% highlight bash %}
cd ~/PHY494-resources
git pull
{% endhighlight %}

Copy the notebooks to your work directory

{% highlight bash %}
cd
mkdir ~/PHY494/random-walk
cd ~/PHY494/random-walk
cp ~/PHY494-resources/random-walk/* .
{% endhighlight %}


and launch the Jupyter notebook interface in your web browser[^2]:

{% highlight bash %}
jupyter notebook
{% endhighlight %}

The notebook 1D-example contains external images that go along with the folder.
To view the image, you may need to change the file path in the notebook to your 
current path
