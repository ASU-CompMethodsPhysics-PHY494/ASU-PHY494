# PHY494 --- Topic: Computational Methods in Physics

**Computational Methods in Physics** is an undergraduate class run in
the [Department of Physics](http://physics.asu.edu) at [Arizona State
University](http://asu.edu). The instructor is
[{{site.author.name}}]({{site.author.url}}).

The course provides an introduction to using the computer as a tool to
solve problems in physics. Students will learn to analyze problems,
select appropriate numerical algorithms, implement them using Python,
a programming language widely used in scientific computing, and
critically evaluate their numerical results. Problems will be drawn
from diverse areas of physics.

Resources for the interactive classes are provided in the GitHub
repository [ASU-CompMethodsPhysics-PHY494/PHY494-resources](https://github.com/ASU-CompMethodsPhysics-PHY494/PHY494-resources).

For further details see the [PHY494 Course Page]({{site.course.url}}).
