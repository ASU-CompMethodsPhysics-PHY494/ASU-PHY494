## PHY494 --- Topic: Computational Methods in Physics

**Computational Methods in Physics** is an undergraduate class run in
the [Department of Physics](http://physics.asu.edu) at [Arizona State
University](http://asu.edu). The instructor is
[{{site.author.name}}]({{site.author.url}}).

The course provides an introduction to using the computer as a tool to
solve problems in physics. Students will learn to analyze problems,
select appropriate numerical algorithms, implement them using Python,
a programming language widely used in scientific computing, and
critically evaluate their numerical results. Problems will be drawn
from diverse areas of physics.
